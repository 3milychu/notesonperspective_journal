1,Welcome!,"Notes on Perspective is an embodied data visualization that invites you into a recital
critique at the Mannes School of Music between 14 ensemble members
studying Fantasiestücke Opus 73 by Robert Schumann."
2,About the data,"Immediately after the performance, the performers and listeners wrote open-ended comments about what had just happened and then marked the scores with additional characterizations (what we see here). Each participant then rated their endorsement of two other participants&#39; comments. Comments could be about whatever struck the participants; researchers later coded the comments on what aspects of the music they addressed (e.g., tempo, character, rhythmic motion) and whether they were positive or negative."
3,Interpreting what you see,"There are several different views to help you travel through the performance and experience the data in time from different perspectives. The ""Listener Experience"" view shows comments based on listeners' prior experience with the piece (whether they've played it before, only heard it, or neither). Just remember: gold represents positive reactions, violet represents negative ones,  and blue represents mixed or neutral ones."
